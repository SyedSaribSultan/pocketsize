"""Change the app's typeface in one command.

    python tools/gen_fonts.py --display "Instrument Serif"
    python tools/gen_fonts.py --display "Space Grotesk" --mono "JetBrains Mono"
    python tools/gen_fonts.py --check

The app names exactly two families - one for everything the interface says, one
for its figures - and every sheet consumes those through `--font-ui` and
`--font-num` in web/css/base.css. So changing the face is a one-line CSS edit,
and this script is everything ELSE that one line implies:

    * fetch the family from Google Fonts and subset it (latin, latin-ext)
    * write the @font-face blocks in web/fonts.css
    * repoint the <link rel=preload> in web/index.html
    * repoint the precache list in web/sw.js and bump its VERSION
    * set --font-ui / --font-num in web/css/base.css
    * delete the woff2 files nothing references any more

That last one is not tidiness. Two faces have shipped in this app while
painting no glyphs at all - Bricolage Grotesque for months, then Geist the
moment Fraunces replaced it - each preloaded at the top of the critical path.
A generator that adds a face without removing the one it displaced would make
that the default outcome rather than an accident.

Why self-hosted at all: the CSP is `default-src 'none'` and the product's
headline promise is that nothing leaves your device. A <link> to
fonts.googleapis.com is a third-party request on every visit, so the files are
served from this origin instead.

Why the weights stop at 600: nothing in this interface renders heavier, and
tests/web/verify_fonts.mjs enforces that on the rendered page. Shipping the
bold masters would be bytes that can never be drawn.

VARIABLE AXES. Google's CSS API serves a build carrying only the axes its URL
asks for, and for some families that is fewer than the font has. Fraunces is
the example: the API exposes opsz and wght, while SOFT and WONK - the two axes
that give it its character - exist only in the upstream release. Pass
`--axes` to pin or range them and the script fetches from the upstream GitHub
release instead, instancing the axes down before subsetting:

    --axes "wght=400:600,opsz=36,SOFT=0,WONK=1"

A range keeps the axis variable; a single value pins it and drops the machinery
for it, which is usually a large saving - pinning Fraunces' opsz halved the
file. tests/test_design_system.py gates `--check`.
