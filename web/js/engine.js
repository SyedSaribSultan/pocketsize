/* The worker pool, and the protocol it speaks.
 *
 * worker.js is the compressor: it decodes, encodes the image several ways, scores
 * each one with SSIMULACRA 2 and reports the smallest that cleared the floor.
 * None of that lives here. This module owns only the pool, the dispatch order and
 * the message contract - which is unchanged from the previous interface, because
 * the engine was never the problem.
 *
 * The contract, in full:
 *
 *   out  { type: "probe" }                          -> asks what this browser can write
 *   out  { type: "warm" }                           -> load codecs now (cache is ready)
 *   out  { type: "warm-avif" }                      -> and the big one, at idle
 *   out  { type: "job", id, rev, name, buffer, mime, settings }
 *   in   { type: "caps", caps }                     answer to the probe
 *   in   { type: "progress", id, rev, stage, frac, detail, total }
 *   in   { type: "done", id, rev, result, perf, engines }
 *   in   { type: "failed", id, rev, error, warnings }
 *
 * `rev` is the settings revision the job was sent under. A result that comes back
 * stamped with an older rev is stale - the plan moved while it was working - so it
 * is thrown away and re-queued rather than shown.

 * encode exists. Twelve of those is most of a modest laptop.

 *
 *   deviceMemory <= 4   a genuinely small machine. Four workers, and the read
 *                       window in dispatch narrows with it, because on these
 *                       the failure is not slowness, it is the tab dying.
 *   otherwise           twelve. Chrome CLAMPS deviceMemory at 8 for
 *                       fingerprinting reasons, so "8" means "8 or anything
 *                       above it" and cannot be read as a workstation signal -
 *                       there is no branch above this one to write honestly.
 *                       Twelve is chosen against cores instead: it is what a
 *                       14-core machine reaches under cores-2, and wasm SIMD
 *                       encode scales sub-linearly past that anyway.
