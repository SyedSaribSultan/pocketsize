/* The plan's dropdowns, dressed in the product's own clothes.
 *
 * A native <select> opens the operating system's popup, and no page can style
 * that list - so the only way for the open menu to look like the rest of this
 * app is to draw it. That is a real cost: the native control brings keyboard
 * navigation, type-ahead, touch, the mobile picker sheet and screen-reader
 * semantics for nothing, and every one of them has to be earned back by hand.
 *
 * So this is an ENHANCEMENT, not a replacement. The <select> stays in the
 * document, keeps its id, keeps its options, and remains the model: every
 * `.value` read, every `selectedOptions` lookup and every `change` listener in
 * settings.js goes on working untouched, and this file never became a second
 * place that knows what the plan is. It is hidden from sight and from the
 * accessibility tree, a button and a listbox are drawn beside it, and choosing
 * an option writes back to the select and dispatches the same `change` event
 * the platform would have.
 *
 * That shape is what makes the failure modes survivable. If this module throws
 * on load, if the browser is too old for :has() or popover, if JavaScript is
 * off entirely - the native control is still there, still styled, still
 * working. The interface gets less pretty and stays completely usable.
 *
 * Coarse pointers keep the native control on purpose. A phone's select opens a
 * full-height sheet with momentum scrolling and a big hit area, which is better
 * than anything drawn in a 320px-wide sidebar; replacing it with a floating div
 * would be losing to win an argument about styling.
 *
 * Keyboard model, per the ARIA combobox/listbox pattern:
 *
 *   closed   Enter, Space, Down, Up, Alt+Down   open
 *            Home, End                          open at the first/last option
 *            printable characters               open and jump (type-ahead)
 *   open     Up, Down                           move the active option
 *            Home, End                          first, last
 *            Enter, Space, Tab                  commit the active option
 *            Escape                             close, commit nothing
 *            printable characters               type-ahead within the list
 *
 * Focus never leaves the button while the list is open: the list is
 * `aria-activedescendant`-driven, so a screen reader follows the active option
 * without the focus ring going somewhere the eye cannot see.
