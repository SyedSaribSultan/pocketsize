/* The offline layer. The app is fully client-side, so after one visit it can
 * be fully offline - the whole compressor, codecs included, with no network.
 * That is the "nothing is uploaded" promise made physical.
 *
 * Strategy, chosen for a site with no build step and therefore no hashed
 * filenames:
 *
 *   - The app shell (HTML, CSS, JS, generated tables) is NETWORK-FIRST with a
 *     cache fallback: online visitors always get the latest deploy, offline
 *     visitors get the last one they saw. Nothing here is stale-while-online.
 *   - The heavy, rarely-changing payloads (wasm codecs, faces, icons) are
 *     CACHE-FIRST: they are versioned by their content's nature, and
 *     re-downloading 4MB of codec on every visit would tax exactly the
 *     low-bandwidth people this app serves.
 *
 * VERSION is bumped by hand when the cached set's SHAPE changes (a file added
 * or removed). Content changes need no bump - network-first refreshes the
 * shell, and a codec change ships under a new filename or not at all.
